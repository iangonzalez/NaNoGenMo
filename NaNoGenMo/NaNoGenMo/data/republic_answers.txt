Of course.
for if not, you will have to remain where you are.
But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you?
he said.
With horses!
Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see.
I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is.
Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master.
Acquired!
In the art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather: for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more than I received.
One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.
And even to this are there not exceptions?
Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?
No one would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition.
I said.
He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he appears to me to be right.
Certainly not.
Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil.
Yes.
To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him--that is to say, evil.
He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to human bodies.
Seasoning to food.
If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies.
I think so.
The physician.
The pilot.
In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.
No.
No.
I am very far from thinking so.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
Exactly.
The skilful player.
Quite the reverse.
In a money partnership.
Certainly.
True.
When you want a deposit to be kept safely.
Precisely.
That is the inference.
Clearly.
Certainly.
That is the inference.
Certainly.
True.
Certainly.
That, I suppose, is to be inferred.
No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I still stand by the latter words.
Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
That is true.
True.
Clearly.
True.
Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
I like that better.
I asked.
We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
Yes.
Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.
Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies.
The latter.
Yes, of horses.
Of course.
Certainly.
To be sure.
That is the result.
Certainly not.
Impossible.
Assuredly not.
It cannot.
Clearly not.
Impossible.
Certainly.
I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.
Whose?
I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.'
Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end.
And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one another?
I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer.
Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and anxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot.
You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer you.
If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right one?--is that your meaning?'
--How would you answer him?
Just as if the two cases were at all alike!
I replied; and even if they are not, but only appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?
I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection I approve of any of them.
What do you deserve to have done to you?
Done to me!--as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise--that is what I deserve to have done to me.
The natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows.
Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself.
But of course you won't.
You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?
That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument.
Yes, I know.
Certainly.
I do.
To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.
True.
Yes.
Doubtless.
What is that you are saying?
he asked.
Has not that been admitted?
Yes.
Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.
Certainly not, he said.
Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.
or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?
True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists.
Certainly, he replied.
Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--I know it; but you will be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.
In the strictest of all senses, he said.
I might as well shave a lion.
And remember that I am now speaking of the true physician.
A captain of sailors.
Certainly.
Yes, that is the aim of art.
What do you mean?
I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
Quite right, he replied.
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?
Or have they no need either of themselves or of another?--having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct them, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter.
For every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true--that is to say, while perfect and unimpaired.
True, he said.
True, he said.
To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.
He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally acquiesced.
Yes.
That has been admitted.
He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'
Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?
Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.
I replied.
Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage?
And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us, Thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you know, is to you a matter of indifference.
Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?
Heaven forbid!
Let me ask you a question: Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?
And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make a little progress.
Yes, he said.
Certainly not.
I should not.
Certainly not.
Yes.
True, he replied.
He gave a reluctant assent to this.
I suppose not.
Certainly, he confers a benefit.
said Glaucon.
Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
Very true.
And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he answered.
Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.
Most certainly, he replied.
I said.
Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.
Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?
Certainly.
What a charming notion!
The opposite, he replied.
No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
No; I would rather say discretion.
Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.
Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good as answer yet one more question?
Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just?
Far otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature which he is.
He would not.
He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he would not be able.
Yes, he would.
Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.
True.
Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.
Good again, he said.
Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.
Certainly, he replied.
Yes.
Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.
Yes.
Yes.
I do not think that he would.
Of course.
In prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine?
He would not.
Yes.
That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant?
I dare say.
Yes.
True.
I suppose so.
Yes.
Were not these your words?
They were.
Yes.
That is the inference.
That was admitted.
Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and you shall answer.
True, he replied; and I will add that the best and most perfectly unjust state will be most likely to do so.
No indeed, he said, they could not.
Yes.
I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.
Certainly.
They will.
Let us assume that she retains her power.
Is not this the case?
Yes, certainly.
Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
Yes.
Granted that they are.
Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not oppose you, lest I should displease the company.
I should.
I do not understand, he said.
Certainly not.
No.
They may.
Of course.
True.
We may.
I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
Need I ask again whether the eye has an end?
It has.
Yes.
True.
That is so.
How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?
You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet.
Certainly, he replied.
True.
I agree.
for example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like.
To no other.
Assuredly, he said.
Yes.
She cannot.
Yes, necessarily.
That has been admitted.
That is what your argument proves.
Certainly.
So be it.
I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.
Certainly, I said.
There is, I said, this third class also.
Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice?
In the highest class, I replied,--among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results.
Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse.
I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives.
Why, what else is there?
I answered.
not for the sake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice.
Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar-- 'Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may be a fortress to me all my days?'
For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakeable.
or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?
And even if there are gods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.'
when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us.
And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge of the truth--but no other man.
I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
It is.
I said; for to do so, as I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task.
There can be no other.
Quite right.
Will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything.
When he has only one.
No doubt.
True.
There must.
They will.
Yes.
We shall.
Yes, in considerable numbers.
To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State.
Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the office of salesmen.
Yes, he said.
Yes.
I think so.
Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another.
And when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod.
But what would you have, Glaucon?
I replied.
They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of many other kinds, if people eat them.
Much greater.
Quite true.
That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
Most certainly, he replied.
he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?
No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.
Certainly.
Quite true.
No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never bestowed any attention upon them.
Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price.
No doubt, he replied.
Certainly.
It will.
What do you mean?
I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught him, they have to fight with him.
Certainly.
Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?
I have.
Yes.
A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.
I said; how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?
True.
he said.
Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.
Certainly not.
I do not apprehend your meaning.
Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the other any good.
The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of your remark.
Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing.
Most assuredly.
They are the same, he replied.
That we may safely affirm.
Undoubtedly.
Is not this an enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length.
Can we find a better than the traditional sort?--and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music for the soul.
True.
By all means.
I do.
Yes.
I do not understand your meaning, he said.
We cannot.
he said.
A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and, what is more, a bad lie.
Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original.
First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him.
I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.
Something of this kind, I replied:--God is always to be represented as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in which the representation is given.
and must he not be represented as such?
Certainly.
No, indeed.
Certainly not.
No.
Impossible.
Yes.
Yes.
Assuredly.
Shall I ask you whether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?
I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
Most certainly.
True.
True.
Of course they are.
He cannot.
Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.
If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.
Impossible.
Perhaps, he replied.
I cannot say, he replied.
What do you mean?
he said.
Perfectly right.
Yes.
Can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?
That would be ridiculous, he said.
I should say not.
That is inconceivable.
But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.
None whatever.
Yes.
Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?
Certainly not, he said.
Impossible.
They will go with the rest.
Reflect: our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade.
He will not.
Certainly.
True.
Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?
They are ill spoken.
Yes.
Or the verse 'The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?'
What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another 'Without the knowledge of their parents;' or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?
Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing.
That is clearly the remaining portion of our subject.
Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a man's own loss and another's gain--these things we shall forbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.
Certainly, he replied.
That again, he said, I do not quite understand.
Quite true.
Certainly.
Of course.
Very true.
Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.
You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our State?
Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.
Certainly.
He cannot.
Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both.
True.
Yes, certainly, he said.
They must not.
How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?
Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of thing?
Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen.
he asked.
Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take.
Yes.
That is quite true, he said.
No one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together.
or would you include the mixed?
I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.
Yes; quite unsuitable.
True, he said.
Yes, he said; so much as that you may.
Yes.
Certainly.
True.
You are musical, and can tell me.
The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'
Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian are the only ones which you have left.
I suppose not.
Certainly not.
Would you admit them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
Clearly not.
(Socrates expresses himself carelessly in accordance with his assumed ignorance of the details of the subject.
Yes.
Yes.
Very true, he replied.
They must.
Or is the same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him?
We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul.
The fairest indeed.
That may be assumed.
That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it, and will love all the same.
How can that be?
he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain.
None whatever.
Yes, the greatest.
No, nor a madder.
Quite true, he said.
Certainly not.
No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.
I agree, he said.
Yes, I agree.
Yes, he said.
Why not?
I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health.
Yes, I do.
Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.
My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
I think not.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?
Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
Is not that still more disgraceful?
Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases.
he said.
he said.
Quite true, he said.
Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.
And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?
Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to the practice of virtue.
and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?
Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians.
Will you tell me?
I will, if I can.
he asked.
I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul.
he asked.
In what way shown?
he said.
Assuredly.
Beyond question.
Yes.
Very true.
if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?
True, he said.
For these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.
Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?
Certainly.
Yes.
Yes.
True.
To be sure.
Very true, he replied.
he said.
Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess the truth a good?
and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth?
Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will.
Still, he replied, I do not understand you.
Yes.
Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.
Yes.
What sort of lie?
he said.
Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.
he said.
Truly monstrous, he said.
Yes, great care should be taken.
But they are well-educated already, he replied.
Yes, said Glaucon.
Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature might be added.
Yes.
There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.
Wealth, I said, and poverty.
The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you, any longer take the same pains with his art?
Certainly not.
Very true.
Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
That is evident.
Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of discontent.
he asked.
Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
And supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn more than one stout personage?
Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.
I agree with you, for I think you right.
That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.
You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game.
What limit would you propose?
I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity; that, I think, is the proper limit.
he asked.
Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.
I said.
I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent before their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general.
Yes.
To be sure.
That is not to be denied.
there may also arise questions about any impositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, police, harbours, and the like.
I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves.
Exactly.
Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from praising them.
Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.
I said; you should have more feeling for them.
Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.
Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all.
he said.
son of Ariston, tell me where.
I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as my word; but you must join.
Very good.
Clearly.
The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel?
Very true.
Clearly.
Of course.
Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering.
Certainly not.
Not by reason of any of them, he said.
Yes.
There certainly is.
I asked.
The name of good in counsel and truly wise.
The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.
Much the smallest.
Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State's behalf.
Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in pain, or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not lose this opinion.
If you please.
Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,' you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the examination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.
I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first.
he asked.
Certainly, he replied.
Yes.
Undoubtedly.
In both, as I should imagine, he replied.
Why so?
Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else.
I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice, and have failed to recognise her.
I cannot, but I should like to be told.
Exactly.
Certainly.
Yes; that is their principle.
Yes.
Very true.
Not much.
Precisely.
Certainly.
Like, he replied.
He will.
True, he said.
Certainly, he said.
An easy question!
he said;--under the circumstances, I am quite content.
Take the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g.
he asked.
Impossible.
Yes, he said, they are opposites.
Very true.
Certainly.
Let us take that class, he said.
Yes.
Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.
Certainly.
Yes.
Certainly, he said.
Yes.
The object of science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture.
Yes.
Yes.
Certainly.
That is plain.
Yes, he said, it constantly happens.
Would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him?
I should say so.
Clearly.
Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.
Is it a third, or akin to one of the preceding?
I should be inclined to say--akin to desire.
Certainly not.
You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.
Yes, he said, there must be a third.
Certainly.
Assuredly.
That follows, of course.
We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.
Yes, he said, we must remember that too.
Certainly.
Quite true, he said.
Very true, he said.
True.
Right, he replied.
Assuredly.
Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in the State or individual.
There is no difference in my opinion, he said.
If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
Would any one deny this?
No one, he replied.
Never.
Impossible.
No one.
Exactly so.
Not I, indeed.
Yes, certainly.
Clearly.
Most certainly not.
Let us say so.
Exactly so.
What do you mean?
he said.
he said.
That is certain.
True.
Exactly so, he said.
True.
Assuredly.
In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.
Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous.
he said.
There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.
The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.
Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.
You, he said.
Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.
Yes, but discourse should have a limit.
and how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?
Tell us how these things will be.
Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what I perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place.
What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs?
or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them?
No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker.
You cannot.
Yes.
That is the inference, I suppose.
And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?
That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.
he said.
And we shall reply: Of course they do.
Certainly they should.
--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?
That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
I suppose so, he said.
that different natures ought to have different pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different.
Precisely.
Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his will.
A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition.
Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.
That would be a jest, he said.
because we never meant when we constructed the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference, but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature.
Certainly.
That will be quite fair.
No one will deny that.
Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd?
You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to many men, yet on the whole what you say is true.
That will never do.
Very true.
Certainly.
That is also true.
Yes.
Very true.
They ought.
Yes.
Yes.
Quite so.
Yes.
Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?
The latter.
What a ridiculous question!
By far the best.
Yes, by far the best.
There can be nothing better.
Certainly.
True.
Yes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind.
Exactly.
Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
In what particulars?
Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not some better than others?
True.
From the best.
I choose only those of ripe age.
Certainly.
Undoubtedly.
Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines.
I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage.
Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock is to be maintained in first-rate condition.
There are many other things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.
Very true.
May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?
Which years do you mean to include?
A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be fifty-five.
They will never know.
Yes, certainly.
By all means.
or any greater good than the bond of unity?
There cannot.
No doubt.
Certainly.
Quite true.
Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.
True.
Of course.
Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply call them rulers.
They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
Their maintainers and foster-fathers.
Slaves.
Fellow-rulers.
Fellow-guardians.
Yes, very often.
Exactly.
Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him.
For example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of God or of man?
Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?
These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them?
Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other.
Yes, and so they will.
Yes, far more so than in other States.
That will be the chief reason.
That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
Certainly.
Yes, there will be no want of peace.
The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost.
Yes, I remember.
Certainly not.
And in so doing they will do what is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the sexes.
You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.
Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.
Yes, I have.
The idea is ridiculous, he said.
I am far from saying that.
Clearly.
That may be assumed.
True.
Very properly.
True.
he said.
I should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan.
By all means, I should say.
In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him.
I approve.
To that too, I agree.
That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
Agreed.
To be sure.
Yes; and we accept his authority.
By all means.
What about this?
In what respect do you mean?
First of all, in regard to slavery?
Do you think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help?
Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?
To spare them is infinitely better.
Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?
Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder.
Very like a dog, he said.
Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.
Very true.
May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual produce and no more.
Pray do.
Very good, he said.
It ought to be, he replied.
Yes, very civilized.
Most certainly.
Certainly not.
Certainly.
Just so.
I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.
For I am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of good to the State.
I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?
The approximation will be enough.
He would be none the worse.
To be sure.
Surely not, he replied.
I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?
Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?
What do you say?
I agree.
Yes, I will.
he said.
I would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows what; and if you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be 'pared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.
In a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.
Do you not see them doing the same?
They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.
The whole.
Yes, of the whole.
Very true, he said.
Am I not right?
Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name.
Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.
Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.
To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.
That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
Certainly.
True again.
Very true.
he said.
Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.
He is wide awake.
Certainly.
We must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.
But we should like to ask him a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing?
(You must answer for him.)
Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
Nothing can be more certain.
Yes, between them.
Certainly.
Undoubtedly.
Another faculty.
Yes.
I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do.
Yes, I quite understand.
Yes.
Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.
Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion.
Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs?
An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them.
That is certain.
Yes.
Yes.
or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.
Yes, something else.
or, rather, how can there be an opinion at all about not-being?
Reflect: when a man has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something?
Can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing?
Impossible.
Yes.
True.
True, he said.
Not with either.
That seems to be true.
In neither.
Both; and in no small degree.
Yes.
No question.
True.
There has.
No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly; and the same is true of the rest.
Quite true.
True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them.
He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting.
I said.
For they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence than being.
We have.
That is certain.
Neither can that be denied.
The latter are the same, as I dare say you will remember, who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.
I shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is true.
he asked.
And how can we rightly answer that question?
Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our State--let them be our guardians.
There can be no question of that.
Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.
There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect.
Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption.
What quality?
Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.
How can there be?
Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?
Never.
Assuredly.
There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.
He cannot.
No indeed.
Certainly not.
Impossible.
Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little progress.
That is certain.
Yes.
Certainly.
Undoubtedly.
To proportion.
They are absolutely necessary, he replied.
The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a study.
I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your opinion.
You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a parable.
Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?
Of course, said Adeimantus.
True.
By all means.
Certainly, he said.
Will he not utterly hate a lie?
He will.
Impossible.
True, he replied.
he said.
In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy qualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.
he asked.
Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?
There I think that you are right.
Are not the public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists?
And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
When is this accomplished?
he said.
Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?
or will he be carried away by the stream?
Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?
Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.
The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you are aware, these new Sophists and educators, who are the public, apply when their words are powerless.
None, he replied.
Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their assemblies; and this is their wisdom.
Indeed he would.
For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.
No, nor am I likely to hear.
Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?
Certainly not.
Impossible.
They must.
That is evident.
and remember what we were saying of him, that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
Certainly, he said.
No question.
Will he not be full of boundless aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride?
To be sure he will.
Far otherwise.
Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?
There can be no doubt of it.
Impossible.
We were quite right.
For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts.
Yes.
A most exact parallel.
Will they not be vile and bastard?
There can be no question of it.
Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?
No doubt, he said.
Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her.
Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying before, that some living authority would always be required in the State having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws.
The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard is the good,' as men say.
At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young; beginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean dialectic, take themselves off.
Just the opposite.
No indeed.
Quite right.
I should imagine not, he replied.
Nay, let me answer for you, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind.
and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.
Impossible.
Anything but unskilful.
Will they disbelieve us, when we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern?
They will not be angry if they understand, he said.
They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which, as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean surface.
No doubt.
Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.
Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
Will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
They would not be so unreasonable.
Neither can they doubt this.
Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
Surely not.
I think that they will be less angry.
By all means, he said.
Surely no man, he said.
Who indeed!
Certainly.
I think not.
Certainly.
he said.
Yes, indeed.
You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?
Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more.
To what do you refer?
We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.
Yes, I said, there is.
Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
Assuredly not.
Yes.
How ridiculous!
True.
Certainly not, he said.
Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, or different from either?
Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.
Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.
You would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road?
Very true.
Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so of other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term 'many' is applied.
The sight, he said.
True.
No, I never have, he said.
Nothing of the sort.
Certainly not.
How do you mean?
Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible.
Of that which you term light, I replied.
Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.
Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?
You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
How?
Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?
No.
By far the most like.
Exactly.
True, he said.
he said.
Very true.
Certainly.
Just so.
God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another point of view?
In what point of view?
You would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, though he himself is not generation?
Certainly.
I have.
Yes, I understand.
Most undoubtedly.
Thus:--There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.
Yes, he said, I know.
That is true.
Some of them are talking, others silent.
True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
Yes, he said.
Very true.
No question, he replied.
And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be perplexed?
Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?
Far truer.
True, he said.
When he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.
Certainly.
Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
Certainly, he would.
Would he not say with Homer, 'Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,' and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their manner?
Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
To be sure, he said.
Men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.
Anything but surprising, he replied.
Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
Very true, he said.
I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not.
he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when they might have a better?
You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.
Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our present rulers of State.
Indeed, I do not, he said.
For, if they are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?
They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.
By all means, he replied.
Quite so.
Certainly.
And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
Yes, that was said.
What quality?
Usefulness in war.
Just so.
True.
No.
Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic, and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them.
Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?
Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal application.
A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.
The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word, number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them?
Yes.
To be sure.
And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?
I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.
Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at all.
What is your notion?
It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
he said.
When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite.
Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same.
for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.
Can sight adequately perceive them?
and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity?
And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness?
And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?
Is not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
You are quite right, he said.
What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?
Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained.
Certainly.
True.
and 'What is small?'
Exactly so.
I do not know, he replied.
This is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being.
Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all number?
Certainly.
Yes.
Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
Certainly.
I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.
They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realized in thought.
Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
You mean geometry?
Exactly so.
Yes, that is what we assert.
They have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life; whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.
What admission?
That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and not of aught perishing and transient.
he said.
Let us do so, he replied.
I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor.
he said.
Yes, I said.
Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
he asked.
I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure.
Will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner?
But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth.
No, he said, not without thinking.
There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already named.
The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are sister sciences--as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with them?
Yes, he replied.
There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying that they did in astronomy.
I said; the prelude or what?
Do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?
For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?
Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning.
Neither can this be supposed.
True.
Impossible, he said.
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?
At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:-- As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.
And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?
Will you admit so much?
Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
And you would say the same of the conception of the good?
Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final quietus.
Certainly not.
Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
I agree, he said.
Certainly, he said.
Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared with the body.
In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring.
To be sure.
for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler, and the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.
I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too much excitement.
Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind.
Yes, I remember.
At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.
Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced?
What evil?
he said.
or will you make allowance for them?
In what way make allowance?
I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous family, and has many flatterers.
Or shall I guess for you?
If you please.
In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
Impossible.
He cannot.
Unquestionably.
Very true.
Would you say six or four years?
he asked.
Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demigods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.
that what has been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
How will they proceed?
They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character.
For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?
Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human characters.
Certainly.
We will compare with this the like character in the individual; and, after that, consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man; and lastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into the tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.
Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us 'how discord first arose'?
Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
How would they address us?
After this manner:--A city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time be dissolved.
And what do the Muses say next?
When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things.
Very true.
Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and will also have some peculiarities.
I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.
He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
said Adeimantus.
The character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.
We have.
A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it.
Yes.
The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do they or their wives care about the law?
Yes, indeed.
First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification.
You mean that they would shipwreck?
Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
I should imagine so.
Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.
Clearly.
The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another.
Anything but well.
A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a poor, helpless creature.
Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body, although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a spendthrift?
As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.
Just so, Socrates.
Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.
Certainly, we may be so bold.
True.
How?
A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from him.
Most true, he replied.
Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the State out of which oligarchy came.
Certainly.
He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the State.
True.
Where must I look?
You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.
There can be no doubt.
Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
What then?
The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
To be sure.
Yes, often.
One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters:--Let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.
And when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?
Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.
for as the government is, such will be the man.
'Tis said so, he replied.
Clearly.
There will.
Because of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made his choice, he may found his State.
For the moment, yes.
Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or cares?
Yes, he replied, many and many a one.
Exactly.
Obviously.
I should.
And they are rightly called so, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary, and cannot help it.
We are not.
Yes, certainly.
Very good.
That is what I should suppose.
Yes.
Certainly.
Very true.
Certainly.
True.
Very true.
When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure--then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical?
Inevitably.
Certainly.
Clearly.
How?
The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?
Yes.
True.
What good?
Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the glory of the State--and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell.
When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
Certainly not.
I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.
That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with liberty.
The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
As we might expect.
Just so, he replied.
Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones.
They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be the richest.
I said.
Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.
What else can they do?
And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?
True.
Clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of Lycaean Zeus.
The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf.
Oh, yes.
Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf--that is, a tyrant?
Inevitably.
The same.
Clearly.
Certainly.
They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.
How do you mean?
He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free and enrol them in his body-guard.
Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying, 'Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;' and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions.
Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.
Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.
The father did not bring him into being, or settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed.
What!
Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.
Yes, quite enough, he said.
and how does he live, in happiness or in misery?
Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.
I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused.
I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.
True.
Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.
I should not wonder.
He has.
That he will.
O my friend, is not that so?
Assuredly.
Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.
Yes, that is sure to be the case.
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.
Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
Yes, indeed, he said.
For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads, robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.
No question.
Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?
Yes, he said, inevitably.
Certainly.
To be sure.
They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and the other is the very worst.
he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight.
That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.
We shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries.
What do you mean?
he asked.
No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
Yes, he said, I see that there are--a few; but the people, speaking generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the worst and maddest.
He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.
Utterly incapable.
Certainly.
Poor.
True.
Yes, indeed.
Certainly not.
Impossible.
And I was right, he said.
I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.
I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.
One of whom I am about to speak.
He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.
The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
What should they fear?
Nothing.
Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual.
Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies.
His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.
He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?
Certainly.
Very true, he said.
Make the proclamation yourself, he said.
Let the words be added.
The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.
It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond; also three desires and governing powers.
he said.
True.
Extremely suitable.
Certainly.
Yes.
Exactly.
Very true.
True, he said.
Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?
Very true.
Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?
There can be no doubt of that, he replied.
I cannot myself tell, he said.
Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?
There cannot be a better, he said.
Has the lover of gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain?
The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted--or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could hardly have tasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.
Yes, very great.
Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.
Far better.
Certainly.
What faculty?
Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.
Certainly.
Assuredly.
Clearly.
Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to himself than the money-maker.
Very true, he said.
Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
True.
There is.
Yes.
What do they say?
That after all nothing is pleasanter than health.
I have.
Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest.
Doubtless, he said.
So it would seem.
I should say not.
Yes.
Yes.
Impossible.
That is the inference.
There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them.
Yes.
Let me hear.
I should.
To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?
No doubt.
Yes.
No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.
Yes.
True.
Certainly.
Clearly, from that which has more.
Put the question in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?
Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable.
Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
Yes.
Necessarily.
Far less.
Yes.
Of course.
Unquestionably.
For they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth.
Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense?
Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.
Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.
Exactly.
True.
Yes.
Clearly.
Yes.
Yes.
Certainly.
Inevitably.
Will you tell me?
There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.
I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?
Yes.
He will.
Yes, he is third.
Manifestly.
Immeasurably greater.
Yes, that was said.
Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented before his eyes.
An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.
Yes, from every point of view.
Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?'
He can hardly avoid saying Yes--can he now?
Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received?
And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable?
Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin.'
Clearly.
Yes.
Very true.
True, he said.
Only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and his great study is how to flatter them.
From no point of view at all.
He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health, in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.
Clearly, he said.
Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
Certainly not, he said.
Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.
In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order.
To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished.
Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but I do not mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them.
for I really do not know.
for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener.
Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?
I do.
Yes.
Impossible.
One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.
Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?
Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?
What way?
An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round--you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the mirror.
Of course.
Yes, he said, but not a real bed.
were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?
Yes, I did.
If you please.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, there are three of them.
Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the ideal bed and not the two others.
Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is the author of this and of all other things.
Yes.
Certainly not.
I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make.
Certainly, he said.
That appears to be so.
The latter.
you have still to determine this.
I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view, obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will appear different, but there is no difference in reality.
Of appearance.
Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?
The question, he said, should by all means be considered.
Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?
I should say not.
The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good?
Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?'
Is there any city which he might name?
I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator.
There is not.
There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him?
Nothing of the kind is recorded of him.
Yes, I replied, that is the tradition.
Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be able to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders.
Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?
Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?
Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.
The poet is like a painter who, as we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and figures.
Exactly.
Yes.
Yes.
Certainly.
Nay, hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.
What?
That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?
Yes.
Of course.
True.
True.
Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?
or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw?
Neither.
I suppose not.
Nay, very much the reverse.
Just so.
Very true.
Certainly.
What do you mean?
I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small when seen at a distance?
True.
Most true.
To be sure.
True.
Very true.
True.
Certainly.
No doubt.
Probably the same would be true of poetry.
No, there is nothing else.
Though I need hardly raise the question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?
And we were right, he said.
Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more equanimity than another?
Yes.
The latter, he said, is the truer statement.
It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.
True.
True.
Certainly.
How do you mean?
The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required.
he asked.
Clearly.
Indeed, we may.
Whereas the wise and calm temperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre.
Clearly.
Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.
No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.
If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the poets;--the better nature in each of us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too?
Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves.
There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.
Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.
Certainly.
Certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.
Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that any one else would have been.
If there are, they must be of an inconceivable greatness.
The whole period of three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity?
Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.
Of the whole, certainly.
Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?
He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you really prepared to maintain this?
Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in proving it.
Yes, he replied.
Yes.
Yes, he said.
True.
That may be assumed.
Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.
Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them.
Yes.
Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body?
Certainly not.
It is, he replied.
Very true.
Yes, he said, there is reason in that.
Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil.
Certainly.
he said.
Certainly not.
At her love of wisdom.
What did I borrow?
The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice.
I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.
True.
Certainly.
Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.
Certainly.
That is my conviction.
Look at things as they really are, and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the goal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish, slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned.
Certainly, he said, what you say is true.
(Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
