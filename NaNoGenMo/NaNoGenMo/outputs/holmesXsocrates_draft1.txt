Socrates, what do you mean?
he said, you and I together will make it.
But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the soul.
And even to this are there not exceptions?
And the wise is good?
My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, but the truth they never reach?
Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.
Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?
Certainly.
Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies?
or any greater good than the bond of unity?
And therefore the cause of well-being?
To be sure.
You mean that they would shipwreck?
Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,' you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the examination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.
And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?
Of course.
"What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians?
Yes.
Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their results?
Oh, it drives me half-mad to think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help?
But do you know whom I think good?
If you please.
Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal,--what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?
Acquired!
"What will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?
And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make a little progress.
"Why is he said; how can I deny it?
Very true, he said.
Last comes the lover of gain?
You're will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
What admissions?
We shall.
And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily?
I asked, 'the same spot and always conspiring against one another.
Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?
Far truer.
"What on earth can be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?'
"That is a detail which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
And you have no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?
"'One of the most precious public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists?
What evils?
The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State?
The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?
It is.
And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or any other animal?
Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with us and our argument?
Yes.
Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?
What admission?
What do you are going to ask, What that State is: No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another question--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors, or some other?
Very true.
And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
I would rather say sublime simplicity.
And then, as a second thought, begins to be aroused within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks 'What is absolute unity?'
True.
What folly, Socrates, has taken possession of you all?
What else can they do?
After this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
"A little progress.
To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
Yes.
And what happens?
To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
"Had he ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs?
I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not.
Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?
Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.
You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?
and how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?
"You dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated?
Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be the richest.
And what about the painter?--I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?
Quite true, he said.
Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?
Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
Is not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
"I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
"And what do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen who were not boxers?
Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf--that is, a tyrant?
"Then, how do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?
"Well, he is sure to keep an jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.
And therefore the cause of well-being?
I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator.
And next, how does he live?
I should say not.
And then, as a second thought, begins to be aroused within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks 'What is absolute unity?'
That is not to be denied.
And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?
"Yes, that is still more disgraceful.
Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?
"'One of the most precious public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?
What do you say?
I should say so.
And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad?
That is so.
And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will temperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?
she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?
Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
Very good, I said; then what is the next question?
Much greater.
How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke--just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?
You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet.
The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel?
Will you tell me?
Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?
Could you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life?
Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?
He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?
Yes.
And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change?
Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies?
No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never bestowed any attention upon them.
And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the gods?
Perfectly right.
But this time I clearly explained the class which I mean?
Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?
"How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?
Why so?
Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?
Is it a third, or akin to one of the preceding?
And are you really prepared to maintain this?
Certainly not.
Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver?
Certainly.
"Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?
"My dear there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy qualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.
Well, and are these of any military use?
Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in the State or individual.
Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?
"He had nothing on expeditions together; and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.
And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge?
Yes, very often.
What did she do on a new coat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter, who is left poor and desolate?
Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?
Which years do you mean to include?
"And what did he come into being, and what is he like?
Yes.
Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?
No doubt.
But shall we be right in getting rid of them?
Yes.
And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?
Yes, very often.
How so?
Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original.
Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?
He will.
Will they not produce corn, and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?
Assuredly.
Where does the thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?
Yes.
What is more gainful than perfect justice?
Inevitably.
Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body?
And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
How do you mean?
asked at feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting.
And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes drunken, lustful, passionate?
Certainly not.
"You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
What do you deserve to have done to you?
What would he tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes drunken, lustful, passionate?
"'No, I am greatly charmed.
And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?
Certainly.
"And how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?
"Witness: I should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.
I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would make to us?
We are not.
Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
We have it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?
Certainly not.
But what he ought or ought not to fear?
Assuredly.
Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?
Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?
or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable?
Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?
there may also arise questions about any impositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, police, harbours, and the like.
Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?
No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?
You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet.
Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?
"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason or sense?
"What on earth can be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?'
Certainly.
Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and the other is the very worst.
"And have you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?
Like, he replied.
Your windows would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation?
To be sure.
And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.
What is that you are saying?
Yes, certainly, he said.
How do you distinguish them?
Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself.
When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame--at such a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap within him?
They were.
But imagine one of these owners, the master say of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves?
Yes.
And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?
Let us take that class, he said.
Is not his case utterly miserable?
Certainly.
And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
Yes, he would.
What question?
You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain?
"What I expected to love those whom he thinks good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?
There would be a be a better, he said.
"Where did you mean?
"'I quite follow you,' said to have the same nature.
But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
Certainly.
And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
"Experience," said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.
Why not?
That will never do.
How was that?
Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in proving it.
Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?
Certainly, he said.
"And how did their own business; and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes?
Certainly.
And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?
Quite right, he replied.
This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?
Certainly.
And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?
Certainly.
In prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine?
I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.
Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
I agree, he said.
As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?
Certainly not.
And what may that be?
True.
What is to be done then?
he said.
Is not this the case?
"He must guard himself, for he may find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage.
And do we know what we opine?
"I am very far from praising them.
And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?
"The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure.
And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?
asked the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?
How was that?
It is the more strange, since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
Which are they?
and 'Who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.
that what has been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
Exactly so.
"What will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?
"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every one of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our present rulers of State.
), having no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?
Yes.
And this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of citizenship?
Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?
Indeed, I do not, he said.
We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?
But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?
"I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?
Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?
Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.
You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?
Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
And also to be within and between them?
Quite true, he said.
"A call good and another which you call evil?
I agree, he said.
Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?
Certainly.
Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens?
"Well, you know father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
By far the best.
I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would make to us?
I might as well shave a lion.
What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?
We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
Put the question in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?
Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same.
Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, but the truth they never reach?
I should not wonder.
Will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
One would think him into being, or settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed.
Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?
"Through the rest of the company joined in my request, and Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself.
Then who could this American be, and calculation?
I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
What do you mean?
There I think that you are right.
"Many times; but what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?
What a ridiculous question!
Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?
Certainly.
I said; the prelude or what?
Clearly.
Are you say?
True.
"Who then are the true philosophers?
True.
He roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken possession of you all?
You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.
May I suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public danger--he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men?
he said.
Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?
Has not that been admitted?
"What's sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians?
It appeared suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?
"By the way, would it bore you to ask, I said, what will be our answer?
"By train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
And the possibility has been acknowledged?
"I hear that it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?
Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort?
Certainly.
Do you not see them doing the same?
Nay, hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.
And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a special care of the State?
A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and, what is more, a bad lie.
Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?
Yes, I said, there is.
And has not the eye an excellence?
Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense?
Socrates, what do you mean?
They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
Clearly.
And what shall we say about men?
"My dear fellow, is it possible you do you mean?
Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
Yes.
Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
Clearly.
And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by him?
I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused.
And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?
"Well, you know father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men--you would agree with me there?
Yes, he is third.
Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
"There can be that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.
What should they fear?
Not with either.
Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?
Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
To what do you refer?
Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole?
How will they proceed?
Did you see Miss Doran on of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?
I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves.
And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
The skilful player.
Is there any city which he might name?
"I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished.
Am I not right?
"You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
"And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?
And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be perfectly ordered?
I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.
--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?
Of course.
I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?
The object of science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture.
Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just?
There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
Then what is your meaning?
And when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod.
But will the imitator have either?
They will never know.
Are you term oligarchy?
Right, he replied.
Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?
Certainly.
And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?
Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
"On your question--you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?
Impossible.
Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other?
If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
I would rather ask the question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail of fulfilling them by their own defect?
Certainly.
Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust?
"'Yes, our little place is wise--the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?
I choose only those of ripe age.
In what manner?
To be sure.
--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?
"Experience," said Polemarchus.
How so?
Nay, very much the reverse.
You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?
For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts.
And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
I dare say.
"And how did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?
It will.
In what way shown?
Certainly not.
We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike?
The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.
And how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the nobler sort of birds not a few.
And they are rightly called so, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary, and cannot help it.
Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?
I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as my word; but you must join.
Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with us and our argument?
And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one another?
And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
Yes, he replied.
Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
"'One of the most precious public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists?
Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?
"It is knowledge of the eternal, and not of aught perishing and transient.
True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?
I cannot say, he replied.
And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
I should say so.
And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
At her love of wisdom.
"It is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?
Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
"What's other?
How?
And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?
They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?
"'No, I had valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it.
Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent, and the good soul a good ruler?
Yes.
And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?
Impossible.
"Who would associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure--then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical?
I think not.
And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of money-making--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them?
I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul.
Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just?
and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth?
"What can it the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
That after all nothing is pleasanter than health.
In what particulars?
Neither.
As they are or as they appear?
"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required.
You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?
Certainly.
What?
In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
There are many other things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.
And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
Were not these your words?
"If his motives were innocent, sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction?
Let me ask you a question: Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?
But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other States?
I cannot say, he replied.
Have you good authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they are dead 'They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men'?
Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.
Why?
Neither can this be supposed.
Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition)?
"'Yes, our little place is wise--the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
Are you term oligarchy?
And what do the Muses say next?
This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
Yes.
What, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up?
I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first.
And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?
No doubt, he said.
But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
You, he said.
And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?
Nothing of the kind is recorded of him.
And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?
Yes.
And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths?
"Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another 'Without the knowledge of their parents;' or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?
and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?
I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
"How is this stage of their lives to last?
"Witness: It conveyed no of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and figures.
How can we?
True.
And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?
for if not, you will have to remain where you are.
And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable), would he not be ridiculous?
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the worst and maddest.
And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?
That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
And what do they receive of men?
And why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too?
that what has been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
No one.
But this time I was set on going, to speak?
What else can they do?
Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a State,--what is the greatest good, and what is the greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil?
If you please.
We know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?
"Yes, but only for an excuse for not facing the battle?
Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they are dead 'They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men'?
Very true, he said.
And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins?
Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
Take the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g.
Pray what is your own day when he was alive?
And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?
"'What, folly, Socrates, has taken possession of you all?
He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he would not be able.
Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to the oligarchical State?
But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth.
How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?
"My opinion is not master of himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.
And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness?
"I one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right one?--is that your meaning?'
But how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy?
Yes.
"Then what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance?
"Witness: I to give them back to him?
And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the same thing?
Yes, he said.
But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of citizenship?
Yes, he replied.
And the same observation will apply to all other things?
Yes.
The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is told by him?
She cannot.
And what is the prime of life?
Who indeed!
Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?
Yes.
And what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the bed?
he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain.
Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?
An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.
The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?
said Glaucon.
We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike?
And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be perplexed?
And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, Thrasymachus?
That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?
Yes.
And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
asked at feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting.
We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
What quality?
Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator?
They would not be so unreasonable.
"What other?
Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.
Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion?
Let the words be added.
But were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?
Very true.
May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
"The gentleman I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
Do you think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help?
"Yes; I shall not feel easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
All of whom will call one another citizens?
Yes.
And what is the next question?
No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker.
How do they act?
Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the other any good.
This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty--in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold--he, I say, your lover of beautiful sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the just is one, or that anything is one--to him I would appeal, saying, Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not also be unholy?
Yes, very great.
Though I need hardly raise the question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?
Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained.
I suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?
Assuredly.
How can there be?
What should they fear?
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?
I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
"'How would fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves?
Why so?
Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth?
Impossible.
Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can he live without it?
What is your notion?
And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?
That is not to be denied.
When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of guardians for our city, must they not be those who have most the character of guardians?
Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, or different from either?
Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?
"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.
Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution?
"By no means easy to overcome, he replied.
And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain?
Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians.
But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects?
Clearly.
And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?
"Well, obviously it could not have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war, which they must practise like the men?
We shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries.
"And he is a man with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?
he asked.
And is he not truly good?
"It is your opinion.
I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged?
Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure--all others are a shadow only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls?
No.
We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class?
"The 'Lone Star' had preceded.
Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, or different from either?
Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike?
I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?
She raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from him.
And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?
"The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure.
Well, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings between man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about insult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment of juries, what would you say?
Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering.
What do you mean?
This is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being.
And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
Because of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made his choice, he may found his State.
And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable), would he not be ridiculous?
Much greater.
And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?
True.
And that which hurts not does no evil?
I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator.
Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole?
and remember what we were saying of him, that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or is she the same which we found her to be in the State?
Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
And what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall proper youth?
Where were we going, upwards to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.
What do you whether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?
I suppose so, he said.
And the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing else?
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution?
"He had nothing on expeditions together; and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.
Has not that been admitted?
Yes.
And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to breed from the best only?
Yes.
And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?
"Not in or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will.
And has not the soul an excellence also?
I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows.
and 'What is small?'
No.
Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge, but lighter than ignorance?
or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?
In what way shown?
Certainly not.
What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue?
What a ridiculous question!
"'You cannot say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?
Yes, indeed, he said.
How so?
Because he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn more than one stout personage?
In what respect do you mean?
Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?
Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, indivisible,--what would they answer?
Very properly.
"Have you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?
When he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.
But will you be so good as answer yet one more question?
The question, he said, should by all means be considered.
Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
What do you mean?
Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?)
Seasoning to food.
But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme?
Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.
And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
Can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?
Say then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?--that it has a democratic origin is evident.
Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything.
Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?
Yes; that is their principle.
"What is the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor?
With horses!
And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors--is the life of shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with it?
We may.
"What have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be perfectly ordered?
I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as my word; but you must join.
And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
Wealth, I said, and poverty.
But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?
The approximation will be enough.
Or drought moisture?
Very like a dog, he said.
What do you tell me of any other suitable study?
That follows, of course.
Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?
Manifestly.
Is the sections of this division have different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from him.
All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad?
Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some part of virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.
"And how did at first, that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil?
To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State.
And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character?
Certainly, he confers a benefit.
What was the relation between them, and what do the rulers call the people?
That was admitted.
Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?
What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another 'Without the knowledge of their parents;' or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?
What makes you say that?
By far the best.
Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music?
It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
That will be the way?
Done to me!--as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise--that is what I deserve to have done to me.
You would say--would you not?--that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desire; or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when a person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the realization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent, as if he had been asked a question?
and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.
How can that be?
Certainly not.
And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the State is just?
"I do not pass from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite.
Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and weaker?
They were.
Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?
What do you mean?
First you began with a geometry of plane surfaces?
and must he not be represented as such?
How do you mean?
No doubt.
What do you mean?
Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?
Did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue--how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?
Yes.
Then you think that the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?
Very like a dog, he said.
Is not this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth?
Nay, hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.
Had she the same which we found her to be in the State?
Yes.
Yes, I said, a jest; and why?
Certainly.
And has not the eye an excellence?
I said; the prelude or what?
But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?
First you began with a geometry of plane surfaces?
There cannot.
And opinion is to have an opinion?
An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them.
And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?
O my friend, is not that so?
For if, as you say, justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the stronger?
There could be no from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?
Will you admit so much?
There can be no question of it.
Inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?
True.
And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?
You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?
And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?
That is the result.
"The he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change, and pity them?
asked the same pains with his art?
And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole life of man?
It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.
What that State is: No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another question--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors, or some other?
In what respect do you mean?
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same?
He sank his face onto his arms and wisdom and reason?
And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?
or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?
And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
Yes.
I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?
A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a poor, helpless creature.
In what respect?
Very true.
How so?
The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
Why should they not be?
Exactly so, he said.
And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
How?
Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?
Yes.
But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
I asked, 'the same spot and always conspiring against one another.
"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?
Certainly.
Do I take you with me?
Yes, that was said.
Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law?
Impossible.
"Now, then, let us raise a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?
Tell us how these things will be.
What do you mean?
Clearly.
And what then would you say?
I do.
And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?
"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?
What are you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?
Yes, that was said.
Then we shall want merchants?
To no other.
They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?
Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?
Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
he said.
"And pray what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies?
"My dear there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy qualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.
would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant?
Quite true.
"The Coroner: Did your father make any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?
True.
And how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the nobler sort of birds not a few.
Yes.
Where were we going, and harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite harm?
Of course they are.
Why so?
Neither can this be supposed.
And what in ours?
There must.
And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes drunken, lustful, passionate?
A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a poor, helpless creature.
Must I call it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?
That is true.
And are you really prepared to maintain this?
Yes.
You see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?
Probably the same would be true of poetry.
What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of legislation?
Most true.
"What did you go beyond just action?
I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator.
And that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?
They would not be so unreasonable.
What is it?
Tell us the truth, being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?
I am very far from thinking so.
And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?
Yes.
And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?
There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
Why not?
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?
Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver?
Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?
And what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall proper youth?
That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
"How would you answer, Socrates, said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it; whereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?
Yes.
And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
and how does he live, in happiness or in misery?
But do you observe the reason of this?
I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first.
I suppose that we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?
Surely not.
And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two?
Certainly.
And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence?
Very true.
Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
Yes.
"And are you really prepared to maintain this?
Certainly.
What do you deserve to have done to you?
"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to be told.
The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like the just State?
or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, I say, any similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and another without end?
Certainly not.
Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him?
"Oh, to the that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?
What?
True, he said.
We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?
And they are rightly called so, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary, and cannot help it.
"What that State is: No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another question--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors, or some other?
You're will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?
I said; for to do so, as I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task.
And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced by what I have just said; what more can I do for you?
because we never meant when we constructed the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference, but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature.
And what do you think they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?
The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one else a weaver--shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants?
A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.
What may that be?
For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.
"'You are called merchants?
He cannot.
Why, where can they still find any ground for objection?
There has.
Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?
How do you mean?
But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health?
Certainly.
Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?
How so?
Certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.
This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?
Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries?
They will not be angry if they understand, he said.
And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself?
Certainly not.
Which appetites do you mean?
We have.
Is not that still more disgraceful?
There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.
And so you understand me?
I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and you shall answer.
The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?
I'll lock it up in my strong box now and that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?
Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much reputation in any?
It is the more strange, since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation?
Clearly.
Will you explain your meaning?
(Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?
"Excuse me, to be the truth.
Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest of the body?
Let us take that class, he said.
No reference to the class which I mean?
asked at feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting.
But do you observe the reason of this?
he asked.
It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but of the good only?
Certainly.
And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?
asked the are--a few; but the people, speaking generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.
And the possibility has been acknowledged?
And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?
But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus, what do you mean?
"You may address me as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.
Where is your father's place in the evening?
That is quite true, he said.
How?
For they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth.
And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow?
Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
"Were you engaged to the have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or cares?
Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him.
Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver?
Yes.
Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?
I replied; and even if they are not, but only appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests?
I cannot say, he replied.
Was she his client, his friend, and the other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?
Beyond question.
Did this never strike you as curious?
Yes.
And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
"How can we have when I saw him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never bestowed any attention upon them.
and must he not be represented as such?
You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?
Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
There certainly is.
Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it?
True.
"And how did their own business; and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes?
I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might have possessed all things--to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?
for example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like.
And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?
Yes.
"And have you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?
In what way make allowance?
Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?
"There is the only one remaining.
We acknowledged--did we not?
Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you?
Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all number?
and must he not be represented as such?
You mean geometry?
That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be found possible--as among other animals, so also among men--and if possible, in what way possible?
I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous family, and has many flatterers.
How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are needed now?
He is wide awake.
Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a better partner than the just man?
Yes, the greatest.
"And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
screamed the danger, if upon reflection I approve of any of them.
The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?
he asked.
Something that is or is not?
Certainly.
In what way shown?
"I do not to act in the spirit of them?
He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.
Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing.
How?
Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children?
"That's the worst of it, just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he would not be able.
So he said to me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
"I should rather say, if he is to be a man at all.
The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do they or their wives care about the law?
Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
We may.
"'How would fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves?
Yes.
And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them--are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?
Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic, and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them.
Your windows would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?
"'Yes, our little by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul.
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
"I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?
he said.
And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange to the barbarians?
Yes, something else.
How can there be?
Yes.
Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?
Just so, Socrates.
Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, but the truth they never reach?
"Yes, he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?
Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
True again.
"And are you really prepared to maintain this?
True.
And what do you say of lovers of wine?
Could you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life?
Yes, quite enough, he said.
But is not war an art?
"I could see that blooms in the spring-time of youth.
And was I not right, Adeimantus?
Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?
See that light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
"I said, that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them.
And by contracts you mean partnerships?
"Is a wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?
And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?
and how does he live, in happiness or in misery?
How so?
If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue?
Surely not, he replied.
What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?
"He must guard himself, for he may find that there must be a third.
And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?
He will.
And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?
"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?
And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before?
Reflect: our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade.
Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three?
said he, said, the reverse of ignoble.
And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound--he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of fears and lusts?
Not I, indeed.
And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
Exactly so.
And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to breed from the best only?
Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves.
Do you remember?
Yes, that is what we assert.
And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
Yes.
and 'What will you call justice?
No indeed.
Or any affinity to virtue in general?
Most true.
What then?
Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.
"'You cannot say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?
he said.
I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would make to us?
I asked.
Why should they not be?
Of course.
And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?
Neither can this be supposed.
Why?
"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?
Yes, I did.
You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?
"She showed me, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
What can this highest knowledge?
He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?
Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.
And what of passion, or spirit?
said Polemarchus.
And what do they call them in other States?
He would not.
And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul?
Yes.
But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?
"'You are called merchants?
One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.
Let me ask you now:--How would you arrange goods--are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows from them?
True.
We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?
"If I tell her she has no precedence among other women.
And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
"They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting.
Then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?
Quite true.
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
I choose only those of ripe age.
And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?
Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?
What was the mistake?
"Well, there seems good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
"You had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable), would he not be ridiculous?
I choose only those of ripe age.
And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable), would he not be ridiculous?
"In answer twice six, or three times four, or six times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer you.
And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?
Yes.
"Will you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money?
If you please.
And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure?
I should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan.
But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?
That is certain.
"But you would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
If you please.
And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?
Of appearance.
And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation?
Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared with the body.
Did you think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help?
What admission?
Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
Clearly.
Who is he?
Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another point of view?
I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
Impossible.
And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?
Yes, I have.
Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:-- As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.
Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse.
And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations, or when he has only one?
They are the same, he replied.
And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use?
We shall.
And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called unnecessary?
Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.
And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?
Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price.
Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music?
"'No, I am greatly charmed.
Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?
What do you say?
What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians?
Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.
How so?
That has been admitted.
What has she appears in Homer?
"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, any city which he might name?
And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?
Very properly.
Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in the darkness of ignorance?
Far otherwise.
Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
"I really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
Which of us has spoken truly?
If the former, she had probably lead to the fairest conclusion.
And what are these?
By all means.
And what do the rulers call one another in other States?
What way?
Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?'
he asked.
"Have they thought of looking away from the truth?
Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not some better than others?
Very good, I said; then what is the next question?
What?
But where, amid all this, is justice?
In a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.
Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good as answer yet one more question?
It ought to be, he replied.
How so?
Yes.
"Why does fate play such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?
Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?
Then must not a further admission be made?
he said, you and I together will make it.
What have we let him off, or what shall we do?'
For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakeable.
What do you mean?
I said; for to do so, as I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task.
But can you imagine, Glaucon, that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you imagine, I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and loved by them?
he said.
Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest of the body?
Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received?
But if you have why, then, how could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, because they are appearances only and not realities?
By all means, I should say.
Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies?
He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow?
"'Put the image in another point of view?
"How did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike?
Precisely.
But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is going to speak?
"My dear to him, will bear the loss with more equanimity than another?
Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him?
There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them.
"Then, as the natural author or maker of the bed?
Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?
And in so doing they will do what is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the sexes.
And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?
He cannot.
Do you agree?
"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
"And how did at first, that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil?
I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.
And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?
Assuredly.
What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?
When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
What of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded?
Yes.
"How do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?
"Oh, but he had only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when others will tell you of brightness and beauty?
Why so?
Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more equanimity than another?
True.
Do you think that still more disgraceful?
Puzzle as I would, I could make it.
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?
When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite.
And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?
Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?
Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?
True.
But is not war an art?
True.
But how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?
Most undoubtedly.
Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?
Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder.
Do we admit the existence of opinion?
They will.
Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be painful?
Yes.
And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and pure not-being?
He looked across at my companion with despair in the plural number; not one of them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game.
Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is it?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this?
Certainly.
And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own land, and share in the common temples?
Certainly.
The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
Certainly, he said.
Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?
Will they not be vile and bastard?
Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?
In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
What is the process?
Yes.
), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?
Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the office of salesmen.
And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
True, he said.
True, he replied; but what of that?
I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer.
Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?
"We could see the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan.
and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?
The idea is ridiculous, he said.
Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good deal of chance about them?
I should not.
Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which is the subject of their art?
He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he appears to me to be right.
What is it?
"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that is true, what sort of general must he have been?
What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than justice and the other virtues?
That seems to be true.
"Do you mean between them?
But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.
Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time?
"I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
Which of us has spoken truly?
Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
But where, amid all this, is justice?
Certainly.
But will you be so good as answer yet one more question?
I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent before their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general.
"You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection?
Just so.
But this time I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
he said.
In what way?
A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it.
or would you include the mixed?
I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure.
Who is that?
He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally acquiesced.
And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, Thrasymachus?
Because he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn more than one stout personage?
Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
he said.
"But why are you not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?
Most certainly.
For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part?
asked suddenly; and I shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly be shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time be dissolved.
And by contracts you mean partnerships?
I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?
if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?
or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?
Assuredly.
And which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
Not with either.
But where are the two?
Yes.
and how does he live, in happiness or in misery?
"A little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word, number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them?
What do you mean?
he asked.
"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?
No.
or would you include the mixed?
Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I will choose them, he replied.
Will they not be vile and bastard?
And we were right, he said.
And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?
I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused.
And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?
That is certain.
"Were you engaged to the the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will be to preserve the average of population?
Because of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made his choice, he may found his State.
But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?
Yes, he would.
And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?
Anything but unskilful.
What do you mean?
What evil?
Can any other origin of a State be imagined?
They would not be so unreasonable.
"'And what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?
I agree.
And that which hurts not does no evil?
If the former, she had a great opinion of his own power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.'
Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge?
"No, he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
And does not the latter--I mean the rebellious principle--furnish a great variety of materials for imitation?
True.
What evils?
Seasoning to food.
"But what sort?
Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other.
And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by him?
My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
But let us consider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?
That is what your argument proves.
They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?
True.
Does not exceptions?
Nothing.
"What other?
Assuredly not.
Suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?
They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
I do.
Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him?
or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either case should we mind about concealment?
Will not tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are needed now?
Yes.
What can this highest knowledge?
"'Yes, our little place is to possess the truth?
But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
That is not to be denied.
Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength?
"I have an inspector and I have given you my reasons.
"But what, then, did Simonides say, and according to you truly say, about justice?
I rang the bell and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor.
No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?
Yes, he said.
"What can he hope to discover some other?
Most certainly, he replied.
"What is it, a third, or akin to one of the preceding?
It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond; also three desires and governing powers.
"How could I not right?
No, there is nothing else.
And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own person--the tyrannical man, I mean--whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all--will not he be yet more miserable when, instead of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant?
Or the verse 'The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?'
At what age?
Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the other any good.
And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a State?
One would think him into being, or settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed.
But ought we to attempt to construct one?
They ought.
How dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?
The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf.
And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'--Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?
Yes.
"'And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
he asked.
"Did I not tell you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and willingly of evil?
I think so.
If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction?
True.
Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
I agree, he said.
What do you mean?
We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.
But where, amid all this, is justice?
Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?
"And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?
Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see.
Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?
How can there be?
And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
"I have no doubt that I am very likely to have forgotten, he said.
Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which is the subject of their art?
Quite true.
And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or force, or enchantment?
"I have an inspector and two races were drawn different ways: the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things.
I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth?
Yes.
What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?
For these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.
"And have you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?
No doubt.
And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one?
Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a man's own loss and another's gain--these things we shall forbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.
So he said to me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him?
Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?
"I I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse.
Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a general notion of them?
Too little, if he pays them.
"A call justice vice?
She smiled, but there was said.
Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd?
Of course they are.
How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?
Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained.
But where are the two?
How can that be?
shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?
Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.
And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?
Very true.
Imitation is only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?
Certainly not.
Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?--What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?
Yes, I said, there is.
"What did you go beyond just action?
Impossible.
Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs, how else would you feed the beasts?
Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and will also have some peculiarities.
Does that look well?
he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight.
And will not their wives be the best women?
Yes.
I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged?
said he, with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure--then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical?
Why do you say so?
God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another point of view?
All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions?
I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?
"How could ever have existed?
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.
What do you mean?
First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him.
The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good?
He would not.
But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?
Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound--he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of fears and lusts?
Is not this an enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue?
You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your opinion?
Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?
"I one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right one?--is that your meaning?'
Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?
They will not be angry if they understand, he said.
"But you would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
To proportion.
Where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests?
Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of discontent.
What will he next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?
I agree, he said.
And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?
I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure.
But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects?
You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer you.
Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?
I suppose not.
Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the whole class or a part only?
"In your heart of hearts, do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
Where were we going, and harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite harm?
Certainly.
"And you think the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain, which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you wonder, I say, at this?
What else can they do?
Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
What do you mean?
That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but upon this condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre?
To be sure, he said.
And now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?
Certainly.
Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would give the city the name of agricultural?
Certainly.
But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him?
I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd?
Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?
And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make a little progress.
Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny?
In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him.
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
Good again, he said.
), having no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?
(Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?
He will not.
And the possibility has been acknowledged?
Did he make no to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods of life?
What quality?
Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?
Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
"What can it mean, that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth?
And we were right, he said.
We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need of lamentation and strains of sorrow?
In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring.
Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study?
Certainly.
But what is the next step?
"'About the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end.
And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?
for I really do not know.
And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
No.
Is not this true?
Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply call them rulers.
But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players?
Certainly.
"Why am I especially not to be let off?
Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented before his eyes.
Is it possible that even now, when I give you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?
(You must answer for him.)
What admissions?
Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
beat his father if he opposes him?
Certainly, he would.
But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or teacher of any?
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State to be the most miserable of States?
"Yes; one of my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but I do not mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them.
Had she the same which we found her to be in the State?
Most certainly, he replied.
And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?
"'About the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end.
"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?
"Only one little item in another reverse.
And what do the rulers call one another in other States?
I should say so.
"Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not also be unholy?
"'One of the most precious public possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?
By all means, he replied.
Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?
No, I never have, he said.
And he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one?
"Experience," said to fail in intelligence?
And how is the error to be corrected?
Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?
That he will.
Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?
Assuredly not.
Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?
And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
"What I expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally?
or, rather, how can there be an opinion at all about not-being?
And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads?
Yes, that was said.
And what happens?
Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.
Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?
I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.'
And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
Yes.
and 'What is small?'
he asked.
Do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor.
And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same manner?
"Yes, her father brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first.
Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?
That he will.
Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making branch?
By all means.
And what do the Muses say next?
"'The work appears to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.
Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
And remember that I am now speaking of the true physician.
Do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?
Granted that they are.
"When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you, any longer take the same pains with his art?
"I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
Socrates, what do you mean?
"'One of the most precious public possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
O my friend, is not that so?
"My dear fellow, is it possible you do heaven knows what; and if you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be 'pared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.
"You have come to me to tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?
"'We have judged it best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?
"'And my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us?
The same.
And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice.
"Which is the art of painting designed to be--an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear--of appearance or of reality?
There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect.
And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?
for as the government is, such will be the man.
But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?
Certainly.
You recognise the truth of what I have been saying?
I do.
And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and so on?
Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
And what happens?
Very true.
And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
"I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?
Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.
But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a physician?
There must.
And the lover of honour--what will be his opinion?
"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, many other abominable crimes.)
Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
In what point of view?
And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?
Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her.
"What did you go beyond just action?
True.
And the just is the good?
The skilful player.
And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations, or when he has only one?
Exactly.
And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
I suppose not.
Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
"In answer twice six, or three times four, or six times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer you.
Do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good?
You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a parable.
Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?
Yes, I do.
Which are they?
I asked indeed they are, a disgrace?
Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
Yes.
What danger they were to be brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?
Yes, of horses.
When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?
Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock is to be maintained in first-rate condition.
But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?
The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
What division?
I agree.
And what are these?
Clearly.
The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
screamed the danger, if upon reflection I approve of any of them.
You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?
True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists.
But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects?
Yes.
Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all number?
No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?
were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?
You have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?
Certainly not.
Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness of vision in them?
Certainly not.
And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?
To be sure.
What is your notion?
No reference to the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?
For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?
Then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?
And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?
But ought we to attempt to construct one?
"I was amused by her society, and she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones?
What then?
And next, how does he live?
Yes, he said.
But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the soul.
--How would you answer him?
And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard?
A captain of sailors.
He roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken possession of you all?
"I see it, were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends have all things in common.'
In what point of view?
Yes.
You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?
A tall, stout official had come down the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument.
Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry?
Very true, he said.
Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?
I said.
What else can they do?
he said;--under the circumstances, I am quite content.
How so?
What good?
Am I not right?
Assuredly.
When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not mean to include that case?
For, if they are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and disease?
That after all nothing is pleasanter than health.
And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?
Might not the which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the ideal bed and not the two others.
Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?
Certainly.
And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
Very true, he said.
What evil?
Poor father has never been strong for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?
And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
"In answer him?
What is that?
"I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished.
Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the State did they spring up?
--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?
And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?
Most undoubtedly.
Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?
There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.
Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be preferred?
Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be able to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders.
"Was she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at all?
Yes, far more so than in other States.
May we bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?
Certainly, he said.
Who is that?
"I have nothing to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.
What do you mean?
We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.
And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature?
"You know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first.
Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?
We were quite right.
And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?
Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.
And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally?
It was said.
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same?
No.
Is not that still more disgraceful?
Put the question in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?
What will he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance?
Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in the State or individual.
And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole?
That is certain.
Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some newly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?
Certainly not, he said.
And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain?
"A little thing in comparison with eternity?
Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable, or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless--how shall we know who speaks truly?
Clearly not.
And what do they receive of men?
Anything but well.
But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of things possible, and how, if at all?
said he, with something else.
Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
Just so.
The question now was, who was the with difficulty; a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him?--would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?
You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a parable.
What have realities of such importance to consider?
Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering.
Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
Yes.
Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced?
"My dear fellow, is it possible you do you mean?
"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your help?
And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?
Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man, desire to make himself worse?
"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and can tell what he knows.
Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?
Impossible.
May we bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?
Clearly.
Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?
To be sure.
Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?
Where were saying of him, that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?
He is wide awake.
Suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?
"In view of your from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer.
And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world?
I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
"In what respects?
"Lady St. Simon said something else.
At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision,--what will be his reply?
No one will deny that.
Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?
Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'
Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?
"'I quite follow you,' said to have the same nature.
And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard?
How can there be?
And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
That may be assumed.
Why?
"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every one of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our present rulers of State.
Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another?
he asked.
Your own opinion is, then, that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?
No reference to the things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.
But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection?
"I do not to act in the spirit of them?
"'You cannot say what are these forms of theology which you mean?
He will.
Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?
I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.
He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?'
That is quite true, he said.
Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?
he said.
"Will you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money?
Certainly not.
That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?
Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?
Do you really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of?
"Yes, sir, that extent the people do share.
Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, indivisible,--what would they answer?
They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and the other is the very worst.
Would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him?
Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?
And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder?
"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, exile, just stay where they are and walk about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or cares?
Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?
Yes.
And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies,'--that was what you were saying?
Certainly.
What do you mean?
"That is a detail which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?
You mean geometry?
Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead?
In the strictest of all senses, he said.
And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner influence of fear?
Clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of Lycaean Zeus.
Is not this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth?
That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, if there be such?
Something like fear of death in him?
Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of dogs?
True.
Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us, Thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you know, is to you a matter of indifference.
Or drought moisture?
"I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.
But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion, and in a mean between them?
Fellow-rulers.
And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the others?
Exactly.
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll said, and you would agree (would you not?)
Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other.
What may that be?
Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.
What is most required?
No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker.
Where then?
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?
What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?
"I am about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him.
Have we not here a picture of his way of life?
A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it.
Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will be to preserve the average of population?
Yes, he is third.
There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
Certainly.
Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
Certainly.
Then who is more miserable?
"He had nothing on look foolish, slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned.
And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be perplexed?
"'One of the most precious public possessions of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?
Yes.
"Were you engaged to the the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will be to preserve the average of population?
Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
In what respect do you mean?
There can be no question of it.
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
"How can we have when I do not now know what I did say; but I still stand by the latter words.
Do you think that still more disgraceful?
You cannot.
How do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation?
That will be the chief reason.
How could she, a ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?
Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?
Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?
Certainly.
There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
And I was right, he said.
Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?
Of appearance.
Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?
Will you tell me?
"Who would associate crime with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but more remains to be discussed;--how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies?
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
